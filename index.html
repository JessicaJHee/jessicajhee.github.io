					<h4>Prior to this change, there was a visibility issue with the different methods to create an
						OpenShift component. The workflows were scattered across different views and commands. To solve
						this issue, this webview combines three different workflows cohesively while improving the UI to
						better developer experience.

					<h4> As seen in the demo on the left, before the change, opening a class file was not supported and

						To address this, I created this webview page that calls the decompiler to show the decompiled
						class content that's readable.
						I enjoying having the design freedom for this feature, where I got to pitch my own ideas on what
						the feature should look like based on my understanding of user base and the problem.

					<h2><strong>VS Code XML Extension</strong>: New Formatting Strategy and Settings</h2>
					<p>Java</p>
					<h4>I adapted 10 existing settings of the old formatter to the new formatter and implemented the new
						max line width setting as requested by users. The
						main reason behind rewriting the formatter was to create a fault tolerant formatter that worked
						well even with invalid XML. Read about the new strategy and list of preferences in detail <a
							ref="https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Formatting.md#formatting-strategy">
							here.</a>
						After the experimental formatter was made the default, I'm also responsible for any formatting
						related bugs or additional enhancement requests coming from users. It was very fulfilling to
						have interactions where you get to help out a user with a fix or provide an answer for their
						question.

						This app takes inputs of personal recepies, stores it in a database, and generates a shopping

					<h4>sMaps is a usable map made for students that includes amenity and live weather data that is

						Multiple algorithms like A*, 2-opt, and multi-start results in an optimized search feature that
						is user-friendly with auto-complete.
						To ensure the map is responsive with larger cities, efficient coding and multithreading were
						used to reduce complexity as much as possible.

					<h4> As someone who is a member of the technology industry, I wanted to see how mental health is
						perceived in this highly competitive field.
						This exploratory data analysis of the mental health situation in the technology industry takes a
						closer look of the
						correlation between the user data and the mental health policies at their place of employment
						over time. Extensive cleaning
						has been done to make the initial data make sense and readable.
