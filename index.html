								<h2><strong>MealDork</strong>: A Grocery List Generation App</h2>
								<p>Python, KivyMD</p>
								<h4>I created this app out of my own need of a grocery list app that suits my personal method of shopping, which was previously unavaliable on the market. 
									This app takes inputs of personal recepies, stores it in a database, and generates a shopping list based on user preferences. 
									The app also includes an recipe explore page that uses the Spoonacular API to display popular recipes. </h4>

								<h2><strong>sMaps</strong>: City map tailored for campus life</h2>
								<p>C++</p>
								<h4>sMaps is a usable map made for students that includes amenity and live weather data that is avaliable for 20+ cities worldwide.
									Multiple algorithms like A*, 2-opt, and multi-start results in an optimized search feature that is user-friendly with auto-complete. 
									To ensure the map is responsive with larger cities, efficient coding and multithreading were used to reduce complexity as much as possible.

								<h2><strong>Mental Health in Tech</strong>: A closer look</h2>
								<p>Python, Plotly, Pandas</p>
								<h4> As someone who is a member of the technology industry, I wanted to see how mental health is perceived in this highly competitive field. 
									This exploratory data analysis of the mental health situation in the technology industry takes a closer look of the
									correlation between the user data and the mental health policies at their place of employment over time. Extensive cleaning
									has been done to make the initial data make sense and readable.
